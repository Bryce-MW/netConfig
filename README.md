# netConfig
These are some of the config files that I use for automation on my servers. I try to keep different branches for each server but sometimes multiple servers will need the same branch if they need to share config. These are set up specifically for me so I haven't included all of the required packages etc in documentation and some of the constants in these files may be specific to my situation and not work in other cases or need to be changed. This is not really ment to be used by others but I decided to share it incase anyone gets any use out of it or I need to share something with someone explicitly.
